# Road Trip Overview with Updated Plan

### Pre-paid Costs & Budgeting
- **Gas Vouchers:** We’ll each grab $300 in gas vouchers before we start. This will make it easier to budget and split the gas costs without worrying later.
- **Other Cost Splits:** We could use a shared app like Splitwise to track expenses as we go. It’ll help with splitting costs for food, activities, and other smaller expenses.

### **Final Thoughts**
With gas and ferry prepaid, we’ll be set on the essentials. Each day, we can check in on how much we’re spending on food and activities without stressing about the bigger costs. By splitting our costs and using the vouchers, we’ll make sure we stay on budget and keep it fair. Plus, we’ve got lots of free activities to balance out the bigger paid ones!
